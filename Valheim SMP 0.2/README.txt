# Valheim-SMP-Mod-Pack
Mod Pack For Private Valheim Server

THIS PACK IS DESIGNED FOR THE VALHEIM SMP SERVER.

--------------------
INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------

1. Please make sure you have Valheim... duh

2. Extract this zip to a place on your computer, you will need to copy and paste most of the files.

3. Install Thunderstore.io's mod launcher (r2modman:https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)

3. Once in the mod manager, under profile selection, click import.

4. Select the file under the r2modman profiles fold that you got from extracting the modpack zip.

5. Now click on launch modded to open valheim and create the directories needed next. 

6. To make sure this step worked, in the top left corner of the main menu you should see "___ plugins loaded" or something along those lines. If true, then click quit game from the main menu.

7. After that, you need to navigate to your r2modman app data (this is why we launched the modded game, to create the directories)

8. The area you are looking for should be under C:\Users\'username'\AppData\Roaming\r2modmanPlus-local\Valheim\profiles\Valheim SMP\BepInEx (username is the name of your windows profile)

9. Once there, open the plugins folder and paste the plugins from the extracted zip file into this folder (replace all existing plugins, as we want to make sure all files are the same for others)

10. Then, move over to the config folder and paste the config files from the extracted zip file into this folder (replace all existing plugins, as we want to make sure all files are the same for others)

11. After that, everything should be all good to go! Launch Valheim modded and join the server IP (if everything is correct, you  main not need to type it in manually as one of the mods should have our server IP in it for autofill)

--------------------
INSTALL NOTES:
--------------------

* We use a mod launcher instead of manual install to give us the options to play vanilla still, or any other mod pack variation as r2modman allows for profiles. 

* Most of the mods used in this pack are compatibile with the r2modman launcher, which means for any non existential mods, if should be extremely easy to disable to your liking.

* Since some of these mods are from the Nexus platform, they will not appear in this mod launcher, to disable any of these, you would need to go into your config files and adjust accordingly.

* Do not worry about updating these mods as we will release updated packs to have you replace current files with instead.

* For any questions contact any chad in the OKAYDAD discord.
