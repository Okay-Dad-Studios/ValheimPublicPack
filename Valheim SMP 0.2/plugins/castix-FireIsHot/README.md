# FireIsHot for Valheim

Fire Is Hot tweaks the behaviour of fire from torches and the player.

Features:
- You will get the 'near fire' buff from torches now
- You will also get the 'near fire' buff when you're burning
- When walking with a torch equipped, you're not freezing in mountain areas anymore, but you will still be cold
- When you're burning, you're not freezing anymore and you won't be cold
- Torches burn out twice as fast in the rain and in mountain areas for balancing
